> [!CAUTION]
> Before creating Issues, we strongly recommend that you read the [FAQ](https://github.com/ilyhalight/voice-over-translation/wiki/%5BEN%5D-FAQ) section, as well as with existing [Issues](https://github.com/ilyhalight/voice-over-translation/issues)

The voice-over translation of the video is now available not only in YandexBrowser. Very grateful, **[Yandex.Translate](https://translate.yandex.ru/)**, **[sodapng](https://github.com/sodapng)**, **[mynovelhost](https://github.com/mynovelhost)**, **[SashaXser](https://github.com/SashaXser)** and to all other contributors. Thanks <3

## Installing the extension:

> [!WARNING]
> If you use Tampermonkey 5.2.0+, don't forget to [enable](https://github.com/ilyhalight/voice-over-translation/issues/662#issuecomment-2160768958) Developer mode or use Tampermonkey MV2

1. Install the extension **[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)** (An alternative for Safari: **[UserScripts](https://apps.apple.com/app/userscripts/id1463298887)**)
2. **[«Install the Script»](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilyhalight/voice-over-translation/master/dist/vot.user.js)**

## List of functionality:

1. Video translation from [one of the available languages](LANG_SUPPORT.md) in russian, english or kazakh
2. Translation of streams to YouTube (works with a slight delay)
3. Displaying subtitles generated by the neural network
4. Displaying subtitles from the site (YouTube additionally displays subtitles that are automatically translated by the site into the selected language)
5. Saving used subtitles (supported formats: `.srt`, `.vtt`, `.json`)
6. Saving the audio track of the translation (in `.mp3` format)
7. Automatic video translation when opening
8. Sliders for changing video volume and translation
9. Automatic setting of the translated video volume (as in Yandex browser)
10. Synchronizing the translation volume with the video volume
11. Limiting the translation of videos from your native language (you can select the language in the menu)
12. Translation with hotkey
13. Setting up the design of subtitles

### Useful links:

1. Javascript library (vot.js): **[Link](https://github.com/FOSWLY/vot.js)**
2. Terminal version (vot-cli): **[Link](https://github.com/FOSWLY/vot-cli)**
3. Wiki: **[Link](https://github.com/ilyhalight/voice-over-translation/wiki)**

## Note:

1. I recommend allowing autoplay of "audio and video" to avoid errors when working with the extension
2. The extension cannot translate videos longer than 4 hours (translator API limitation)

## List of supported sites:

You can see the full list of supported websites and all restrictions related to their support in **[wiki](https://github.com/ilyhalight/voice-over-translation/wiki/%5BEN%5D-Supported-sites)**

### Our domains:

These domains can be set in the extension settings (only those domains that can be changed without rebuilding are listed here):

#### Proxy-server

It's necessary for proxying requests if it is not possible to make a direct request to the Yandex servers

- [vot-worker.toil.cc](https://vot-worker.toil.cc/health) (Load balancer between proxy servers)
- [vot-worker-s1.toil.cc](https://github.com/FOSWLY/vot-worker)
- [vot-worker-s2.toil.cc](https://github.com/FOSWLY/vot-worker)
- [vot.deno.dev](https://github.com/FOSWLY/vot-worker)
- [vot-new.toil-dump.workers.dev](https://github.com/FOSWLY/vot-worker) (⚠️ doesn't work in Russia)

#### Media Proxy-server

It's necessary for proxying `.m3u8` files and correcting the translation for indirect links to `.mp4` or `.webm`(for more information in the repository)

- [media-proxy.toil.cc](https://github.com/FOSWLY/media-proxy)

#### VOT-Backend

It's necessary to translate additional sites that use the `.m3u8` or `.mpd` video format.

- [vot.toil.cc](https://github.com/FOSWLY/vot-backend)

## How to build an extension?

1. Install Node.js 18.18+ / Bun.sh
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Bun:

```bash
bun install --yarn
```

3. Building an extension:

   3.0. All versions at once:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   3.1. All minified versions at once:

   ```bash
   npm run build:min
   ```

   3.2. Only the regular version:

   ```bash
   npm run build:default
   ```

   3.3. Only the usual min. versions:

   ```bash
   npm run build:default-min
   ```

### How to patch vot.js

1. Make the necessary changes to node_modules/vot.js/the required file
2. Save the changes using:

NPM (not tested, but it should work):

```bash
npx patch-package vot.js
```

Bun:

```bash
bunx patch-package --use-yarn vot.js
```

Do not use patches from the `bun patch` or from any npm packages. They will be incompatible with the patch-package, and may also break when updating the package.

### How to update localization files

For all interaction with localization files, the localize-tui utility is made.

To call the utility, use the command:

```bash
npx @toil/localize-tui
```

You can read more about the utility [here](https://github.com/ilyhalight/localize)

## Customization of appearance:

The extension supports customization of the appearance using Stylus, Stylish and other similar extensions

Example of changing styles:

```css
/* ==UserStyle==
@name         VOT-styles
@version      16.09.2023
@namespace    vot-styles
@description  LLL
@author       Toil
@license      No License
==/UserStyle== */

:root {
  --vot-font-family: "Roboto", "Segoe UI", BlinkMacSystemFont, system-ui,
    -apple-system;

  --vot-primary-rgb: 139, 180, 245;
  --vot-onprimary-rgb: 32, 33, 36;
  --vot-surface-rgb: 32, 33, 36;
  --vot-onsurface-rgb: 227, 227, 227;

  --vot-subtitles-color: rgb(var(--vot-onsurface-rgb, 227, 227, 227));
  --vot-subtitles-passed-color: rgb(var(--vot-primary-rgb, 33, 150, 243));
}
```

Working with the modern version of Tampermonkey (MV3) has not been tested in most browsers. If there are problems, it is recommended to use Tampermonkey Legacy (MV2)

To activate the script in Tampermonkey (MV3), you must [enable "Developer Mode"](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php#Q209)
